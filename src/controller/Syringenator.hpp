/**	A function to respond to a line detector being triggered.

 *	needs to reorient the robot to clear the sensor, but also to prevent the line
 *	from being hit again.
 *
 *	The simplest way to do this is to rotate the opposite wheel forward until the
 *	sensor clears. Because the sensor is forward of the wheel it will rotate away
 *	from the line as the opposite wheel moves forward. This should work as long as
 *	the curvature of the line is not too great.
 *
 *	This may need to be two routines, one for each sensor
